Gone are the days of "puts" debugging :)

This file describes how to debug Nebula scripts with the Tcl debugger
coming with TclPro.

Nebula now comes with the tclnebula.dll, which allows to load Nebula as
a standard Tcl extension. This makes it possible to use the full Nebula
functionality from inside a normal tclsh (as opposed to the nsh shell
coming with Nebula). The coolest thing about this: Nebula scripts can
now be debugged by using one of the existing Tcl debuggers (for instance
the TclPro debugger). 

===============================================================================
Here's how you can use Nebula functionality inside a tclsh84:

(1) start a tclsh84
(2) load Nebula as a tcl extension:

    % load tclnebula
    
    You should see the usual startup messages from the Nebula kernel.
    
(3) try out a few Nebula commands:

    % new n3dnode bla
    % bla.getcmds
    % bla.txyz 10 20 30
    % delete bla
    
    Tada! Nebula in a tclsh :)


===============================================================================
Here's a step by step guide how to debug a Nebula script with the TclPro debugger:

(1) install the current TclPro from http://www.scriptics.com, TclPro started 
    as commercial project, but can now be used for free, yeah!

(2) create a Nebula script "test.tcl":

    # this must be present before any Nebula specific statement
    load tclnebula
    
    new n3dnode pos
        sel pos
        .txyz 0 10 0
    sel ..
    
(3) launch the TclPro debugger and create a new project, fill the project settings
    as necessary, set the interpreter to "tclsh84".
    
(4) start debugging and be happy :)


===============================================================================
Known problems:

The TclPro debugger forbids to overwrite the standard 'puts' command. Nebula
normally overwrites 'puts' to reroute the puts output into the Nebula console.

As a workaround, Nebula will not touch the original 'puts' command if it is
running as an extension. This means you will only get 'puts' output to stdout,
and not to the Nebula console.
