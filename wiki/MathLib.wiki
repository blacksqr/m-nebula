*Main changes:*
 * All classes and functions turned to templates
 * Intermediate computations removed, in all possible cases.<br> For instance:<br> Previously the *line* was defined as vector *a* and vector *e*. Vector *e* was computed as vector's *b* - *a* difference (*a* and *b* are original ends of the segment).<br> Hence, in case it was used as a segment, *a + e* was computed to get second end of the segment. Now *line* keeps both *a* and *b* to avoid this computation and resulted floating point fluctuations. Those fluctuations are result of the conversion of float/double 32/64-bit values to Intel CPU FPU's 80 bit registers.
 * Comparisons of vector's are firm, *memcmp* is used.
 * The triangle's edges always used in
