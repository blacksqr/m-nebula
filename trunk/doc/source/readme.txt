This is the source distribution package for the 'Nebula Device'.
It currently compiles under Win9x, WinNT and Linux. 

Nebula is an open source and completely free C++ framework
for developing portable scriptable realtime 3d applications
(with emphasis on games). Its main strengths are: 

- totally free, no license fees or whatever
- portable, currently runs on Win95, WinNT, Linux
- integrated scripting system based on Tcl/Tk,
  directly invoke methods on C++ objects through the script interface
- flexible animation system, basically, any numerical object attribute
  can be animated
- no conceptual difference between serialized objects and
  conventional scripts, serialized objects are simply a sequence
  of script commands
- hot pluggable objects, e.g. switch between OpenGL and D3D rendering
  on the fly

See the other txt files in /doc/source for further details.
