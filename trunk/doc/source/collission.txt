Nebula's collision system
==========================
22-Jul-00   floh    created

Nebula has a framework for a collision system bundled in the ncollide
class package. This framework alone allows for collision detection between
moving spheres, but polygon-level collision detection is possible by
subclassing a single class (nCollideShape).

The relevant classes for the collision system are:

nCollideServer
nCollideContext
nCollideObject
nCollideShape
nCollideReport

nCollideServer
--------------
The nCollideServer object is the only object which is visible in Nebula's
named object hierarchy and serves purely as a factory for nCollideContext
and nCollideShape objects. The nCollideServer object also defines a
'collision type table', where collision check relationships between
different collision object types are stored. The relationship types between
collision object types maybe "ignore", "quick", "exact".

nCollideContext
---------------
An nCollideContext object defines one "collision space", where collisions
between moving nCollideObject's are checked and reported. It is also the
factory object for nCollideObjects. The nCollideContext can produce
collision reports for each attached nCollideObject.

nCollideObject
--------------
This is a single entity in an collide space defined by a nCollideContext
object. nCollideObjects can be attached/detached from their nCollideContext
at any time.  An nCollideObject normally has a reference to a shared 
nCollideShape object, which represents the polygon-shape of the object.
nCollideObjects can be positioned in space.

nCollideShape
-------------
This describes the actual shape of an nCollideObject. One nCollideShape
object can be shared between multiple nCollideObjects to reduce memory
usage. The base class nCollideShape object can only describe a sphere,
but subclasses can be derived to describe a polygon-shape (we linked
RAPID to the collision system that way). nCollideShapes can load
themselves from a Wavefront file.

nCollideReport
--------------
This describes a contact between 2 nCollideObjects. It contains the
pointers to the 2 nCollideObjects, a timestamp, a point of contact
and 2 collide normals (normally the averaged normals of the triangles
that are involved in the collision).
